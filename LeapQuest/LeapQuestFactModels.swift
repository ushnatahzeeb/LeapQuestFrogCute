            leapQuestFullContent: """
            Frogs are incredible jumpers! The average frog can jump up to 20 times its body length, which is equivalent to a human jumping over a basketball court in a single leap. This amazing ability comes from their powerful hind legs, which contain large muscles and long bones that act like springs.
            
            The secret to a frog's jumping power lies in its anatomy:
            ‚Ä¢ Their hind legs are much longer than their front legs
            ‚Ä¢ They have elastic tendons that store energy
            ‚Ä¢ Their leg muscles can contract rapidly to generate explosive force
            
            Different species of frogs have different jumping abilities. The longest recorded frog jump was by a South African sharp-nosed frog that leaped 5.35 meters (17.5 feet) in a single bound!
            
            Scientists study frog jumping to improve robotics and understand biomechanics. The principles behind frog jumping are being used to design more efficient robots and prosthetic limbs.

            Rivers are incredibly diverse ecosystems that support a vast array of life forms. Despite covering only 0.8% of Earth's surface, rivers are home to approximately 40% of all fish species on our planet!
            
            Rivers provide essential ecosystem services:
            ‚Ä¢ Fresh water for drinking and irrigation

            Jumping is a fascinating demonstration of physics in action! When you jump, several physical principles work together to propel you into the air.
            
            The Science Behind Jumping:
            ‚Ä¢ **Kinetic Energy**: Your muscles convert chemical energy into mechanical energy
            ‚Ä¢ **Potential Energy**: As you rise, kinetic energy converts to gravitational potential energy
            ‚Ä¢ **Momentum Conservation**: Your body's momentum must be conserved during the jump
            ‚Ä¢ **Newton's Third Law**: The ground pushes back with equal force
            
            The optimal jumping angle is approximately 45 degrees for maximum horizontal distance. This is because it balances the vertical and horizontal components of velocity.
            
            Factors that affect jumping ability:
            ‚Ä¢ Muscle strength and power
            ‚Ä¢ Body weight and composition
            ‚Ä¢ Joint flexibility and range of motion
            ‚Ä¢ Technique and coordination
